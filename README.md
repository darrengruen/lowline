# LowLine

*This is not fully production ready*

A simple PHP implementation of the awesome [lodash](https://https://lodash.com/docs)
javascript library.

A large portion is thin wrappers around native PHP functions. Where ever the native
function may have mutated the original value, a different implementation is used.
